I'm a first year PhD student from School of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Arlington. My research interest includes medical image processing, deep learning, neuroscience, and AGI. Before pursuing my PhD degree, I finished my undergraduate from School of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Dajiang Zhu of MIND Lab from School of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Arlington.
